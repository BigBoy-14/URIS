                <h3>GIANT PANDAS</h3>
                <div class="animal-info">
                    <p><strong>Giant Pandas</strong> (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are one of the world's most beloved and recognizable animals, known for their distinctive black-and-white coloring. Native to the mountain forests of central China, pandas are actually bears and belong to the family Ursidae. These gentle creatures have a specialized diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo, despite having a digestive system typical of carnivores.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                    <p>Adult pandas typically weigh between 75-135 kg (165-300 lbs), with males being about 10-20% larger than females. They stand about 60-90 cm (2-3 ft) tall at the shoulder when on all fours. Their most distinctive features include black patches around their eyes, ears, and across their body, contrasting with white fur elsewhere. Pandas have a "thumb" (actually a modified wrist bone) that helps them grip bamboo stalks.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Diet and Feeding</h4>
                    <p>Pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, consuming 12-38 kg (26-84 lbs) of bamboo daily. Despite being classified as carnivores, their diet is 99% bamboo. They have strong jaw muscles and large molar teeth adapted for crushing tough bamboo. Interestingly, pandas can only digest about 17% of the bamboo they consume, which explains why they must eat such large quantities.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Behavior and Habitat</h4>
                    <p>Pandas are solitary animals that communicate through scent marking and occasional vocalizations. They are excellent climbers and can swim well. In the wild, they inhabit mountainous regions of central China at elevations between 1,200-3,100 meters (4,000-10,000 ft), where dense bamboo forests grow. Each panda needs about 4-6.5 square kilometers (1.5-2.5 sq miles) of territory.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Reproduction</h4>
                    <p>Female pandas are fertile for only 2-3 days each year, making reproduction challenging. Cubs are born extremely small (about 1/900th of their mother's weight) and are completely dependent for months. They begin eating bamboo at about 6 months but may nurse for up to a year. In the wild, pandas typically live 15-20 years, while in captivity they may live over 30 years.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Conservation Status</h4>
                    <p>Pandas were classified as Endangered until 2016 when their status was upgraded to Vulnerable, thanks to conservation efforts. There are about 1,800 pandas remaining in the wild, with about 600 more in zoos and breeding centers worldwide. Their survival is threatened by habitat loss and climate change, which affects bamboo growth patterns.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Unique Adaptations</h4>
                    <p>Pandas have several special adaptations for their bamboo diet, including extra-thick throat lining to protect against bamboo splinters and a digestive system that passes food quickly (in about 8 hours) to maximize nutrient absorption. Their black-and-white coloring may provide camouflage in their snowy and rocky habitat, while the dark eye patches may help them recognize each other.</p>
