                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <div class="animal-info">
                    <p><strong>Gemsbok</strong> (Oryx gazella) are large antelopes native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, easily recognized by their long, straight horns and striking black-and-white facial markings. These majestic animals are perfectly adapted to desert life, with a pale gray or tan coat that reflects sunlight and helps regulate body temperature in extreme heat.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                    <p>Gemsbok stand about 1.2 meters (4 feet) at the shoulder and weigh between 180-240 kg (400-530 lbs). Both males and females have impressive ringed horns that average 85 cm (33 in) in length, with the female's being slightly longer and thinner. Their distinctive facial pattern includes black and white markings that may help deflect heat and recognize individuals.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Habitat and Distribution</h4>
                    <p>Primarily found in the Kalahari Desert, gemsbok can survive in extremely arid conditions where few other large mammals can thrive. They inhabit open grasslands, scrublands, and deserts of Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and parts of Angola. Their range has expanded into previously unoccupied areas due to the creation of artificial waterholes.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Adaptations</h4>
                    <p>Gemsbok have remarkable physiological adaptations for desert survival. They can raise their body temperature to 45°C (113°F) to avoid sweating, and their specialized kidneys produce highly concentrated urine to conserve water. They obtain most of their moisture from food, including water-storing plants like tsamma melons, and can survive without drinking water for extended periods.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Behavior</h4>
                    <p>Gemsbok live in herds of 10-40 animals, typically consisting of females and their young, while males often form bachelor groups or become solitary. They are most active during cooler morning and evening hours. When threatened, gemsbok will often face predators head-on, using their sharp horns as formidable weapons against lions, hyenas, and wild dogs.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Diet</h4>
                    <p>As grazers and browsers, gemsbok feed on grasses, thorny shrubs, wild melons, and roots. They use their hooves to dig for bulbs and tubers during droughts. Their efficient digestive system extracts maximum nutrients and moisture from poor-quality vegetation, allowing them to thrive where other herbivores would starve.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Conservation</h4>
                    <p>Gemsbok are classified as Least Concern by IUCN, with stable populations throughout their range. They are economically important for ecotourism and regulated hunting. Some populations outside protected areas are threatened by habitat loss and competition with domestic livestock, but their ability to survive in harsh environments provides some protection against human encroachment.</p>
