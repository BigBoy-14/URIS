                <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                <div class="animal-info">
                    <p><strong>Warthogs</strong> (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild members of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. These sturdy animals are easily recognized by their four sharp tusks and the thick protective pads ("warts") on their faces.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                    <p>Warthogs stand about 75 cm (30 inches) at the shoulder and weigh between 50-150 kg (110-330 lbs). They have large heads with distinctive facial warts (actually thick skin pads) that serve as protection during fights. Their curved tusks can grow up to 25 cm (10 inches) long. Despite their fierce appearance, warthogs are not aggressive unless threatened.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Behavior and Social Structure</h4>
                    <p>Warthogs are social animals that live in family groups called sounders, typically consisting of females and their young. Males tend to be solitary after reaching maturity. They are diurnal animals, most active during early morning and late afternoon. When threatened, warthogs can run at speeds up to 48 km/h (30 mph), and will often back into burrows to defend themselves with their tusks.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Diet and Feeding</h4>
                    <p>Warthogs are omnivores but primarily grazers. Their diet consists mainly of grasses, roots, berries, bark, and occasionally carrion. They often kneel on their calloused, padded knees to feed on short grasses. Their snouts are specially adapted for digging up roots and bulbs.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Habitat and Adaptations</h4>
                    <p>Warthogs prefer open areas and use abandoned aardvark burrows for shelter. They enter the burrows backwards, ready to defend themselves if predators follow. Their sparse hair and tough skin help them tolerate high temperatures, while their tusks are used for digging and defense against predators like lions, leopards, and hyenas.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Reproduction</h4>
                    <p>After a gestation period of 5-6 months, female warthogs give birth to litters of 2-4 piglets in a burrow. The young remain in the burrow for several weeks before joining the sounder. Piglets are weaned at about 4 months but may stay with their mother for over a year.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Ecological Role</h4>
                    <p>Warthogs play an important role in their ecosystem by aerating soil through their digging and serving as prey for large carnivores. Their wallowing behavior creates small depressions that collect water, benefiting other animals during dry periods.</p>
