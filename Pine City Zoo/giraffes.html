                <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                <div class="animal-info">
                    <p><strong>Giraffes</strong> (Giraffa camelopardalis) are the tallest living terrestrial animals, characterized by their extremely long necks, legs, and distinctive spotted patterns. These gentle giants stand 4.3 to 5.7 meters (14 to 19 feet) tall, with males being taller than females. Their coat patterns are unique to each individual, much like human fingerprints.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Species and Subspecies</h4>
                    <p>Recent research has identified four distinct species of giraffes: the Northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), Southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa), Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi), and Reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata). Each species has unique coat patterns and slightly different geographical distributions across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Neck</h4>
                    <p>A giraffe's neck can measure up to 2.4 meters (8 feet) in length but contains only seven vertebrae - the same number as most mammals, including humans. Their powerful hearts (weighing about 11 kg/25 lbs) pump blood at high pressure to reach their brains. Special valves and a network of blood vessels help regulate blood flow when they bend down to drink.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Behavior and Ecology</h4>
                    <p>Giraffes are social animals that live in loose, open herds. They communicate using infrasonic sounds (below human hearing range) and visual signals. Despite their size, they only need 5-30 minutes of sleep per day, often standing up. Giraffes are not territorial and have large home ranges that vary with seasonal availability of food and water.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                    <p>A giraffe's tongue is about 45-50 cm (18-20 inches) long and prehensile, helping them grasp leaves. Their legs alone are taller than many humans (about 1.8 meters/6 feet). When they run, giraffes move both legs on one side of their body forward simultaneously (called "pacing"), reaching speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Diet</h4>
                    <p>As browsers, giraffes primarily eat leaves, twigs, and fruits from acacia trees and other woody plants. An adult can consume up to 34 kg (75 lbs) of foliage daily. Their height gives them access to food sources unavailable to other herbivores. Giraffes can go days without water, getting most of their moisture from leaves.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Conservation</h4>
                    <p>Giraffe populations have declined by 40% in the last 30 years, with fewer than 69,000 mature individuals remaining in the wild. Major threats include habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Several subspecies are now classified as endangered or critically endangered.</p>
