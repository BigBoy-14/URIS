                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                <div class="animal-info">
                    <p><strong>Monkeys</strong> are highly intelligent primates that belong to the suborder Haplorhini. There are over 260 known species of monkeys, divided into two main groups: New World monkeys (from Central and South America) and Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia). Monkeys are known for their dexterous hands, forward-facing eyes, and complex social behaviors.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                    <p>Monkeys range in size from the tiny pygmy marmoset (about 14-16 cm long) to the large mandrill (up to 1 meter long). Most species have tails, though they aren't always prehensile (grasping). Their hands and feet are adapted for grasping branches, with opposable thumbs on most species. Many monkeys have cheek pouches for storing food.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Behavior and Intelligence</h4>
                    <p>Monkeys are highly social animals that live in troops with complex hierarchies. They communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. Many species use tools - capuchin monkeys use stones to crack nuts, while some macaques use hair to floss their teeth. Studies show some monkeys can perform basic math and recognize themselves in mirrors.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Diet</h4>
                    <p>Most monkeys are omnivores, eating fruits, leaves, flowers, insects, eggs, and small animals. Their diet varies by species and habitat. Howler monkeys are primarily leaf-eaters, while baboons eat meat more frequently. Many monkeys play important roles in seed dispersal through their eating habits.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Habitat</h4>
                    <p>Monkeys inhabit diverse environments including tropical rainforests, savannas, mountains, and even snowy areas (Japanese macaques). New World monkeys are arboreal (tree-dwelling), while some Old World monkeys like baboons are primarily terrestrial (ground-dwelling).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Reproduction</h4>
                    <p>Monkeys typically have one baby at a time after a gestation period of 4-8 months depending on species. Infants cling to their mothers for months before becoming independent. Many species show alloparenting, where other troop members help care for young.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Conservation</h4>
                    <p>Over half of all monkey species are threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and the pet trade. Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection and anti-poaching measures. Some species like the golden lion tamarin have been successfully reintroduced to protected areas.</p>
