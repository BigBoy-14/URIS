                <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                <div class="animal-info">
                    <p><strong>Gorillas</strong> (genus Gorilla) are the largest living primates, characterized by their powerful build, broad chests, and large hands. These gentle giants are primarily herbivorous and inhabit the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. Gorillas are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), each with two subspecies.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Species and Subspecies</h4>
                    <p>The eastern gorilla includes the mountain gorilla (G. beringei beringei) and eastern lowland gorilla (G. beringei graueri). Mountain gorillas are slightly larger and have thicker fur, adapted to colder high-altitude environments. The western gorilla includes the western lowland gorilla (G. gorilla gorilla) and Cross River gorilla (G. gorilla diehli), which are more numerous but still endangered.</p>
                    
                    <p>Adult male gorillas are called silverbacks due to the characteristic silver hair on their backs that develops at about 12 years of age. A full-grown silverback can stand up to 1.8 meters (6 feet) tall and weigh between 136-227 kg (300-500 lbs), with arm spans up to 2.6 meters (8.5 feet).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                    <p>Gorillas have a distinctive body shape with a broad chest, large stomach, and long, muscular arms that are longer than their legs. Their hands feature opposable thumbs and fingers with unique fingerprints, much like humans. Despite their size and strength, gorillas are generally gentle and shy creatures.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Behavior and Social Structure</h4>
                    <p>Gorillas live in stable family groups called troops, typically consisting of one dominant silverback, several adult females, and their offspring. The silverback makes all the decisions, mediates conflicts, and protects the group from threats. Gorillas communicate through various vocalizations, body postures, and facial expressions.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Diet and Foraging</h4>
                    <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on stems, bamboo shoots, and fruits. An adult gorilla can eat up to 18 kg (40 lbs) of vegetation per day. They occasionally eat insects like ants and termites, which provide additional protein. Gorillas spend about a quarter of their day feeding and another quarter traveling between feeding sites.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Conservation Status</h4>
                    <p>All gorilla species are classified as critically endangered or endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Conservation efforts have helped mountain gorilla populations slowly increase, with current estimates at about 1,000 individuals. Ecotourism and anti-poaching patrols have been crucial to their protection.</p>
