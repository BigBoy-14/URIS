                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <div class="animal-info">
                    <p><strong>Lions</strong> (Panthera leo) are large carnivorous felines and the only cats that live in social groups called prides. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are apex predators with powerful builds, with males weighing up to 250 kg (550 lbs) and females up to 180 kg (400 lbs). They have short tawny coats, and adult males sport distinctive manes that range from blond to black.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Species and Subspecies</h4>
                    <p>There are two recognized subspecies of lions: the African lion (Panthera leo leo) and the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica). African lions are found in sub-Saharan Africa, while the critically endangered Asiatic lion survives only in India's Gir Forest. African lions are generally larger with more impressive manes than their Asiatic cousins.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                    <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies with powerful forequarters for pulling down prey. Their retractable claws can grow up to 38 mm (1.5 inches) long. A lion's roar can be heard up to 8 km (5 miles) away, serving to communicate territory and locate pride members. Unlike other cats, lions have a tufted tail that helps signal intentions to other lions.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Behavior and Social Structure</h4>
                    <p>Lion prides typically consist of 5-15 related females, their cubs, and a coalition of 2-3 males. Females do most of the hunting, working together to take down prey like zebras, wildebeest, and buffalo. Males defend the pride's territory, which can range from 20 to 400 square km (8 to 150 square miles).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Hunting and Diet</h4>
                    <p>Lions are opportunistic hunters that prefer to hunt at night. They can consume up to 40 kg (88 lbs) of meat in a single meal and then go several days without eating. While they prefer fresh kills, lions will scavenge when the opportunity arises. A pride's territory size depends largely on prey availability.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Reproduction</h4>
                    <p>Female lions typically give birth to 2-4 cubs after a 110-day gestation period. Only about 1 in 8 cubs survive to adulthood due to predation, starvation, and infanticide when new males take over a pride. Cubs begin hunting at 11 months but remain dependent on the pride until about 2 years old.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Conservation Status</h4>
                    <p>African lion populations have declined by about 43% over the last 21 years, with only about 20,000 remaining in the wild. They face threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and prey depletion. Asiatic lions number fewer than 700 individuals in the wild, making them one of the world's most endangered big cats.</p>
