                <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                <div class="animal-info">
                    <p><strong>Koalas</strong> (Phascolarctos cinereus) are arboreal herbivorous marsupials native to Australia, known for their teddy bear-like appearance. Despite sometimes being called "koala bears," they are not bears at all but marsupials with a backward-facing pouch. Their thick gray fur, large round head, and fluffy ears make them one of Australia's most recognizable animals.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
                    <p>Koalas measure 60-85 cm (24-33 in) long and weigh 4-15 kg (9-33 lb). They have five digits on each paw with sharp claws for climbing, and two opposable thumbs on their front paws for gripping branches. Their fur is thicker on their backside to protect against rain and thinner on their belly to help regulate body temperature.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Habitat and Distribution</h4>
                    <p>Koalas inhabit eucalyptus forests and woodlands of eastern and southeastern Australia, ranging from Queensland to South Australia. They live high in eucalyptus trees and are most active at night (nocturnal). An individual koala's home range depends on habitat quality and can vary from 1 hectare to over 100 hectares.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Diet and Digestion</h4>
                    <p>Koalas are folivores, eating primarily eucalyptus leaves (about 500g daily). They have a specialized digestive system with a long gut and special bacteria to break down the tough, toxic eucalyptus leaves. They get most of their water from leaves and rarely drink, which is why "koala" means "no drink" in some Aboriginal languages.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Behavior and Life Cycle</h4>
                    <p>Koalas sleep 18-20 hours per day to conserve energy due to their low-nutrient diet. Females typically give birth to one joey per year after a 35-day gestation. The tiny, undeveloped joey crawls into the mother's pouch where it stays for about 6 months before riding on her back for another 6 months.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Conservation Status</h4>
                    <p>Koalas are currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss, climate change, and disease. Bushfires particularly threaten koala populations as they move slowly and cannot escape flames quickly. Conservation efforts focus on protecting eucalyptus forests and creating wildlife corridors between fragmented habitats.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Interesting Facts</h4>
                    <p>Koalas have unique fingerprints almost identical to human ones. They communicate through deep grunting sounds and bellows. Despite their cute appearance, koalas can be aggressive when threatened, using their sharp claws and teeth for defense. Their brain is unusually small for their body size, possibly an adaptation to their low-energy diet.</p>
